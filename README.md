## Overview and Origin
---
* Morningstar, Inc

* Incorporated: May, 16, 1984

* Founder: Joe Mansueto

* Morningstar Inc was created after Joe Mansueto left his job as a stock analyst and realized investors lacked the necessary information to make intelligent investment decisions.

* According to crunchbase.com Morningstar has raised a total of $91M in funding over 1 round. This was a Private Equity round raised on Jul 9, 1999. Softbank paid this amount for 20% Stake in Morningstar.

## Business Activities:
---

* Through  investment research Morningstar  compiles and analyzes fund, stock, and general market data,  this allows investors with the necessary information to make intelligent investment decisions.

* Morningstar's customer segment include:
   * Individual Investors
   * Advisors
   * Asset Managers
   * Private Market Investors
   * Retirement Participants
   
* Clients range from start-ups to some of the world’s largest firms, including the New York Stock Exchange and Microsoft. Morningstar reaches more than 9 million individuals around the world and serves 500+ clients that add Morningstar capabilities to their platforms to better serve their users.

* According to Morninstar’s 2019 annual report, while other companies may offer research, ratings, data, software products, or investment-management services, they are one of the few companies that can deliver all of these with the best interest of the investor in mind. By putting investors first, paired with the way they use design and technology to communicate complex financial information, sets them apart from their peers in the financial services industry.

* Morningstar uses 61 technology products and services including HTML5, Google Analytics, and jQuery.

## Recommendations
---

* Morningstar’s rating system  was entirely dependent on average past returns. The flaw in that approach was that by the time the fund received a five-star rating for past performances, it might have been too late to participate. Morningstar has already made some changes to their rating system to include a more forward-looking approach. This is a great example on how Morningstar is implementing changes to meet their client demands. Based on current investor trends I believe that Morningstar should launch a dedicated news service. 

* Top three reasons for to launch a dedicated news service:
    * Being a source of news will have a great impact for the companies future growth
    * News affect decision making for investors
    * Brand visibility

* Some of technologies proposed for this service: 

  * Optimizely | Experimentation platform for marketing, product, and engineering teams, with feature flags and personalization

  * Backbone.Js | Give your JS App some Backbone with Models, Views, Collections, and Events

  * Polymer | A new library built on top of Web Components, designed to leverage the evolving web platform on modern browsers
