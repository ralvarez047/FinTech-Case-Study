# FinTech Case Study
H1 heading: A title for the FinTech case study


## Overview and Origin
---

* Morningstar, Inc

* When was the company incorporated?
May, 16 1984

* Who are the founders of the company?
Joe Mansueto

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Morningstar Inc was created after Joe Mansueto left his job as a stock analyst and realized investors lacked the necessary information to make intelligent investment decisions.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
According to crunchbase.com Morningstar has raised a total of $91M in funding over 1 round. This was a Private Equity round raised on Jul 9, 1999. Softbank paid $91m for 20% Stake in Morningstar.


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Through  investment research Morningstar  compiles and analyzes fund, stock, and general market data,  this allows investors with the necessary information to make intelligent investment decisions.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Individual Investors
Advisors
Asset Managers
Private Market Investors
Retirement Participants
Clients range from start-ups to some of the world’s largest firms, including the New York Stock Exchange and Microsoft. Morningstar reaches more than 9 million individuals around the world and serves 500+ clients that add Morningstar capabilities to their platforms to better serve their users.
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
According to Morninstar’s 2019 annual report, while other companies may offer research, ratings, data, software products, or investment-management services, they are one of the few companies that can deliver all of these with the best interest of the investor in mind. By putting investors first, paired with the way they use design and technology to communicate complex financial information, sets them apart from their peers in the financial services industry.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Morningstar uses 61 technology products and services including HTML5, Google Analytics, and jQuery.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Big Data, Analytics, Robo and Investment Advising.


* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
Augmented Data Analytics and Augmented Data Management
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Commercial AI and Machine Learning
Data Fabric
Blockchain in data and analytics
Continuous Intelligence


* What are the other major companies in this domain?
Three of Morningstar's key competitors are Bloomberg, L.P., MarketWatch, Inc., and Thomson Reuters Corp

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Their extensive line of products has empowered various financial professionals, including individual investors, financial advisors, asset managers, retirement plan providers, and institutional investors to make informed investment decisions.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
Revenue, Profitability and Risk

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
Morningstar’s rating system  was entirely dependent on average past returns. The flaw in that approach was that by the time the fund received a five-star rating for past performances, it might have been too late to participate. Morningstar has already made some changes to their rating system to include a more forward-looking approach. This is a great example on how Morningstar is implementing changes to meet their client demands. Based on current investor trends I believe that Morningstar should launch a dedicated news service. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

#### 4. Write the case study.

Write the finished case study report in a markdown `README.md` file, using the above case study template. Your report should be sufficiently long to ensure you provide all relevant information about the company or project in a thorough manner.

Be sure to cite your sources in an addendum at the end of the report. List all websites, podcasts, blogs, or articles that you consulted in order to write the report, and provide links. Your list should be thorough and account for all sources you used, but it does not need to be a formal works cited page.


#### 5. Upload your case study to your git repository.

You learned some technical aspects of FinTech this week, including how to set up and populate a git repository. As a final step, take your finished case study and upload it to a repository to share with your instructor and class.
